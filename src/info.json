  "district": "These boxes represent a district, or - in BC terminology - electoral ridings. Every district sends 1 directly elected MLA to parliament. The color of the bottom border for each district shows the party that has won any one district's direct seat. Make sure to adjust the sliders and see the difference it makes in Parliament!",
  "region": "These groups of 4 districts represent so-called regions, being made up of multiple districts (4 for this app). In reality, these regions could hold any number of districts, most likely proportional to regional population. In the MMP system proposed by BC Elections, the top-up MLAs will be selected based on the regional popular vote within each region, not the provincial popular vote (like in New Zealand, for example). In this showcase, every region elects 4 district MLAs and 2 region MLAs to give a ratio of 67% district to 33% regional MLAs in parliament (the guide by BC Elections specifies 'around 60% of district MLAs'. The long bar at the bottom of every region gives an overview of the popular vote in this region.",
  "mmp": "This app uses the simplest version of MMP - Mixed Member Proportional: Voters only get one vote on the ballot. Their vote counts both for the district MLA and the overall vote for the region. The 5% threshold for small parties to gain regional seats is not used. I chose this system because it is the easiest to code and showcase. There are other versions of MMP in which any voter gets 2 votes but this is beyond the scope of this app. Please visit www.electionsbc.ca for more information. The table included below the parliament compares the popular vote with the de-facto representation through MLAs in legislature for any given party. "
